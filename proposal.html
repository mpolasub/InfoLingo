            <strong> What is informatics? </strong><br>
            <a href="https://ischool.uw.edu/programs/informatics">“Informatics is the study, design, and development of
                information technology for the good of people, organizations, and society”</a> It applies to a wide
            range of fields, including healthcare, education, technology, and business. As an evolving field,
            informatics plays a crucial role in today’s digital world. It’s important not only for informatics
            professionals to understand its significance, but also for people outside the field to recognize its impact.
        </p>

            <strong>What are the challenges that arise in teaching and learning informatics through current
                platforms?</strong><br> The
            problem with many existing platforms is the static nature of the content and learning. There is a lack of
            user interaction that takes away from the learning process and only promotes absorption of information.
            Active learning is often left out with no meaningful form of feedback to further a deeper understanding. As
            a result, this limits users to apply what they learn to real world situations and concepts in Informatics.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>What are previous attempts at solving this problem?</strong><br> Previous attempts to solve this
            problem include platforms like Coursera and Udemy, which offer extensive
            courses across topics, including informatics. These platforms provide valuable long-form learning but are
            less effective for users seeking quick access to specific terms. They also lack interactive features like
            leaderboards or real-time engagement, which are key to increasing motivation and learning retention.
            According to YouScience, platforms that foster engagement, collaboration, and competition improve learning
            outcomes. Our web app addresses this gap by focusing on specialized term lookups, incorporating
            leaderboards, and encouraging user contributions.

           <strong>What is something that makes your life worse, and that you think that a web app might be able to help with? 
        </strong><br> One smaller personal problem that a web app could help solve is the challenge of keeping up with specialized
            terminology in rapidly evolving fields like informatics. As a student or professional, constantly looking up
            and memorizing terms in fields like AI, data science, and cybersecurity can be overwhelming and
            time-consuming. A web app that organizes and provides quick access to specialized terms, while also offering
            interactive features like leaderboards to gamify the learning experience, would make this process more
            efficient and engaging, improving both understanding and retention.
