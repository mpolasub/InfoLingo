        <p>
            <strong> What is informatics? </strong><br>
            <a href="https://ischool.uw.edu/programs/informatics">“Informatics is the study, design, and development of
                information technology for the good of people, organizations, and society”</a> It applies to a wide
            range of fields, including healthcare, education, technology, and business. As an evolving field,
            informatics plays a crucial role in today’s digital world. It’s important not only for informatics
            professionals to understand its significance, but also for people outside the field to recognize its impact.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>What are the challenges that arise in teaching and learning informatics through current
                platforms?</strong><br> The
            problem with many existing platforms is the static nature of the content and learning. There is a lack of
            user interaction that takes away from the learning process and only promotes absorption of information.
            Active learning is often left out with no meaningful form of feedback to further a deeper understanding. As
            a result, this limits users to apply what they learn to real world situations and concepts in Informatics.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>What are previous attempts at solving this problem?</strong><br>
Previous attempts to solve this problem include platforms like 
<a href="https://www.coresa.com/" target="_blank">Coursera</a> and 
<a href="https://www.udemy.com/?deal_code=&utm_term=Homepage&utm_content=Textlink&utm_campaign=Rakuten-default&ranMID=39197&ranEAID=OOTtr9mlaCk&ranSiteID=OOTtr9mlaCk-xhY8cHhr2nr8HhyNOC0GIg&LSNPUBID=OOTtr9mlaCk&utm_source=aff-campaign&utm_medium=udemyads&gclid=CjwKCAjw9p24BhB_EiwA8ID5BpTV2qMdjmGEFmlbQsb_xCBxbcmgBGw3S-ccKHmRPu1gQOK-9YHu3BoCiPUQAvD_BwE" target="_blank">Udemy</a>, which offer extensive courses across topics, including informatics. 
These platforms provide valuable long-form learning but are less effective for users seeking quick access to
 specific terms. They also lack interactive features like leaderboards or real-time engagement, which are key
 to increasing motivation and learning retention. According to <a href="https://www.youscience.com/resources/blog/student-engagement/#:~:text=Why%20is%20engagement%20important%20in,extend%20to%20real%2Dlife%20situations." target="_blank">YouScience</a>, 
 platforms that foster engagement, collaboration, and competition improve learning outcomes. Our web app addresses this gap
  by focusing on specialized term lookups, incorporating leaderboards, and encouraging user contributions.

           <strong>What is something that makes your life worse, and that you think that a web app might be able to help with? 
        </strong><br> One smaller personal problem that a web app could help solve is the challenge of keeping up with specialized
            terminology in rapidly evolving fields like informatics. As a student or professional, constantly looking up
            and memorizing terms in fields like AI, data science, and cybersecurity can be overwhelming and
            time-consuming. A web app that organizes and provides quick access to specialized terms, while also offering
            interactive features like leaderboards to gamify the learning experience, would make this process more
            efficient and engaging, improving both understanding and retention.

		<h2> App Description </h2>
		<p>The users of the application are primarily student, professional, and lifelong learners who want to expand 
            their vocabulary in certain areas such as data science, cybersecurity, health, and software developments. 
            Students in tech-related fields can use this app to enhance their understanding of industry-specific terms, 
            and professionals can use it to develop their skills and get information on new vocabulary in those fields. 
            The app can also have a significant impact on minority groups by giving them equitable access. The interactive 
            and gamified nature of the app will help bridge the skills gap for individuals with marginalized backgrounds 
            who may face barriers, especially in traditional educational settings. The app's user-generated content, 
            which submits examples of how people use words in real life, creates a shared knowledge community and helps 
            integrate different perspectives into the learning process.
		</p>

		<p> Users will engage with the web app by exploring, learning, and testing themselves on domain-specific vocabulary 
            through three interactive features. First, the app is organized by specific topics, allowing users to focus on 
            vocabulary related to areas such as data science, health, or software development. This organization makes 
            the app more user-friendly and ensures that users are not overwhelmed by unrelated information. Second, the app 
            offers a gamified learning experience, where users can participate in vocabulary quizzes, daily challenges, 
            and earn points for correct answers. These points contribute to a leaderboard, adding a competitive and motivating 
            element to the learning process. Finally, users can listen to the speech audio of words using the Speak.js library 
            to practice pronunciation. This feature enhances the learning experience by allowing users to hear the words spoken 
            aloud and practice their pronunciation, further improving retention and mastery of new vocabulary.
